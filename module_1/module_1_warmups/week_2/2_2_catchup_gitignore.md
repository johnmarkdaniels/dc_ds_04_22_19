### 1. Catch up on all your past warmups if you haven't finished them

### 2. Ask questions 


### 3. git a bit : 
  - take the visualizations you have created and put 	 them in your repository (push)
	- Go and remove them now from the repository and add 	it to a git ignore file

`use ( echo debug.log >> .gitignore`
 `git rm --cached debug.log`
 `git commit -m "Start ignoring debug.log"`
